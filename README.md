# Online_Payment_Fraud_Detection
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to detect online payment fraud using clustering. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and anomaly detection with KMeans/DBSCAN. Visualizations like PCA scatterplots, heatmaps, and fraud frequency charts highlight suspicious patterns and evaluate model performance.
